This weekend I had one of the biggest disappointments in my training so far. But it also turned into something that I really needed, **mental fortitude**.

This was the third back to back weekend I had and I was able tor un the first day fairly easily. I was still pumped from watching Avengers Endgame a couple nights before and I went running with a few friends for the half of the 26.2 miles.

But then the next day I woke up late and exhausted.

I was also very, very sore.

I didn't recover well enough the day before.

I didn't eat everything I was supposed to eat.

I didn't ice anything either.

And I was paying the consequences.

I drove an hour to Orange County to meet with a friend and do some hill workouts as part of the 26 miles.

2 miles in I was done. Mentally and physically.

I felt like I had zero energy, I was in a new place that I had never been at before. There was a lot of overgrowth and so I mentally didn't know where I was going in this canyon. It felt like a maze I couldn't get out of.

On mile 4 I ate one of my energy Gu's and felt like I was going to throw up.

Oh and my body glide was wearing thin and my thighs were beginning to chafe.

Yay.

I was mentally at my limit and ready to quit.

But then I met Yoda.

My friend and I reached the end of the trail and were about to decide whether to keep going or to quit. Then an older man, who must've been shorter than 5 feet asked us in the most energetic voice "Hey guys! How much further are you running?"

We told him a couple more miles. He asked if we wanted to run with him. We looked at each other for confirmation. I think we both knew that this was going to be a timeless moment with this strange, charismatic, little man. We both said "sure!".

We took off running and he immediately started hitting us with nuggets of wisdom. He talked about the importance of having fun while running. "If you're not having fun while running you're doing it wrong. Just quit and something that you enjoy instead." He told us that he was 67 and retired but he had more energy than most 20 year-old's that I know.

Talking with him made the time and the pain melt away. He gave me so much encouragement and advice in regards to running and to life. I loved soaking in every word that came out in between our running breaths.

We went out away from the canyon for a while and then decided to come back. I was simultaneously tired and filled up.

It was one of those moments that I will never forget because it gave me so much life.

Thank you kind stranger for taking me in under your wing for a few miles. I'll never forget it.
