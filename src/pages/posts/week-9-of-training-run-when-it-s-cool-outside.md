This weeks long run was roooooough! On Friday I celebrated my 6th year of marriage, which was amazing! We went to a fancy restaurant called Red Bird and I had Wild Boar and man it was good! And then on Saturday I didnâ€™t do my long run on that day because it was my sisters baby shower that I helped to set up. I stayed up a lot longer than I wanted to that day and so I slept in a little bit and didn't start running until 8 AM on Sunday. That was a big mistake. Pretty soon the sun came out and even though it was just 65 degrees it felt so much hotter and I was sweating profusely. I didn't enjoy that run very much. But I did ask on my Instagram story if I could pray for anyone and I was able to pray for some people during my run and that helped to keep my spirits up. I highly recommend to run when it's cooler it will make your run a lot better.
