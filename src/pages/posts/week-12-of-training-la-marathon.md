I originally wasn't going to run the LA Marathon because I didn't want to spend the money.

Plus I knew that I already ran a fast enough time at last years LA Marathon to qualify for Comrades marathon. I was going to use that time to qualify for Comrades, but it was too old of a time by 3 months to count. The earliest races they were accepting was August 2018 and the LA Marathon was in March. :(

Sooooo I had to cough up $270 because I ended up registering 2 weeks before the 2019 LA Marathon. On top of that I strained my right calf muscle the weekend before and didn't run the week leading up to it.

I showed up a little nervous not knowing how I would do and that I didn't have money to retry at another marathon.

I met up with over 100 other Team World Vision runners at 5 in the morning. We prayed, sang a couple worship songs and then lined up with all of the other thousands of runners.

I also joined up with some friends that I had been running with. I decided to take the first 16 miles easy just to make sure my leg felt okay. I miraculously had no calf pain! So I pushed it the last 10 miles and got a qualifying time!

I was so relieved and so sore. This race really gave me confidence that I could run that distance twice.
