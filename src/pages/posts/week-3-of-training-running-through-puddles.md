The long run this week was a lot of fun! I got up early and went to Will Rogers State beach. It's about 2 miles north of Santa Monica Pier. It was drizzling a bit that day and it rained a lot the night before and so there were some huge puddles along the bike path.

I almost got my shoes soaked 3 miles in and that would've been the worst! Luckily I was able to avoid most of the puddles and I ran down to Marina Del Rey and back to Will Rogers. Along the way I prayed for all of the kids that would be getting sponsored. So far 2 kids have been sponsored! I'm so excited for my friends to build a relationship with the kids that they sponsor!
