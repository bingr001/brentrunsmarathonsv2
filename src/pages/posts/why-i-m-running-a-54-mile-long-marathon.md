At a young age, my parents threw in the towel on their marriage. My mom struggled as a single parent to care for her 5 children in our tiny apartment. Despite our troubled situation, she always found a way to help others less fortunate than us.

We all know what it’s like to struggle, to hurt, and to feel alone. We have all felt the sting of being forgotten or overlooked. Thankfully for most of us these painful moments were just that, they were moments. For millions of children around the world, our temporary feelings have become their permanent reality.

As a new father, I want to set an example of service and compassion for those who have been marginalized the most in the world. I want to lead my home in generosity. Many children, through no fault of their own, live in some of the scarcest situations and don't have any resources to change those circumstances. It's easy to turn a blind eye and disconnect because poverty is a massive systemic issue and it feels like we can’t make a difference. But what if I told you that was a lie?

Everyone can make a difference in the life of one child and that will have an exponential effect on the child's family and community. A small sacrifice makes a huge impact.

This year I have already ran over 300 miles in preparation for a **54-mile race** in South Africa and I want to invite you into being a part of World Vision's sponsorship program with me. My goal is to get 54 kids sponsored ! One child per mile!

Will you sponsor a child for **$39 a month**? You have an opportunity to build a one on one relationship with a child waiting for **clean water, love, and hope**!

May we choose to be the good we want to see in the world.

Best Wishes,

Brent Ingram
