This was the first of the big 4 back 2 back weekends.

This meant that I would be running distances of 20 miles or more on back to back days.

This weekend I ran 26 miles on Saturday and then 20 miles on Sunday.

I ran the 26 miles by myself and it was okay. I was a little sore but not too thrashed.

The next day I met up with a friend from high school at the ebach. He ran 10 miles with me and it was a lot of fun to catch up on life and see how much we had both grown since high school.

I also noticed how different conversations change from high school. A good portion of our conversation was about rent prices in LA and how texting used to cost 10 cents per message when we were in high school.

It was a pretty flat run at the beach and it gave me the mental confidence to take on hills the next week.
