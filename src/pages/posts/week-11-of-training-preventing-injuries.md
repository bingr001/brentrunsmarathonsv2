First, I'm super humbled that 7 kids have been sponsored so far! There are also a couple more people who will be signing up soon!

(This is me inserting a not-so-smooth transition)

This week has honestly been really hard as far as training goes. My right calf has felt strained and I have had to pull back on my runs more than I would like. I think it started because I started incorporating more hills into my workouts and was running at a faster pace that wasn't healthy for me.

If I'm being honest I'm really afraid of getting injured. Especially within these next few weeks. I just recently found out that what I thought was a qualifying marathon time that I ran last year was actually outside of the window needed for this years Comrades Ultramarathon. And so the soonest and closest marathon is the LA Marathon which in just a couple weeks. Because it's so close to the race day it sot $240 that I didn't really have and had to borrow some money from a family member. Thankfully I also found $100 chilling in my Venmo account that I was able to transfer over.

I'm hoping that the rest that I'm giving my leg will help me to perform well at the LA Marathon and that I get a good qualifying time of under 5 hours.

I could use some prayers for my continued health and especially around my calf healing up nicely. Thank you!
