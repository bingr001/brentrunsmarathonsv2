I finally did a long run with other people!

I met up with one of my best friends from college who does triathlons and we went to the Rose Bowl at 6:30 in the morning and it was raining a little bit. It was nice to change locations and have someone to talk to on the run.

We did about 6 miles before we were joined by some of his triathlete friends who planned on doing 18 miles that day. It was awesome to make new friends around an activity that you love. The y were all really solid people and we had some great conversations! But in the middle of our run I heard someone shout my name. I was a little confused, but I looked to my right and past a chain-link fence was a golf course and a friend from college was doing a 7 mile race with her sister, husband and daughter!

It was so cool getting to see her because she and the friend I was running with all met each other at the same time. We all lived next door to each other in a co-ed (sex separated) dorms.

The weather ended up being really nice and it was the "easiest" 23 miles I've ever ran. I highly recommend running with other people if you can. Just like in life it makes the journey easier and more fulfilling.

I'm training for a 54 mile marathon to raise awareness for child sponsorships. Click the link below to join the story and begin a life changing one on one relationship with a child!
