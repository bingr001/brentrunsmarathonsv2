This second week of training was tough!! I was felling pretty tired the whole week and on Thursday instead of running in the morning I ran at night. BIG MISTAKE!

I usually run in the street opposite of traffic because asphalt is better on your joints than sidewalk cement is. Also you can see oncoming traffic and drivers not paying attention easier. But on a particular street there wasn't enough space between me and traffic so I decided to run on the sidewalk. I was keeping a good pace and was in the zone and then I tripped over an unlevel piece of sidewalk and fell HARD! My glasses flew off my face and everything! I got up and kept going, a little slower than before, but was a little shaken. This affected my long run on Saturday. I did my best to rest but my knees were killing me. Also I learned that a 13 mile run is the distance where I need to start bringing water with me. I got sooooo thirsty! And there was no water anywhere! I finally found a water fountain, but no water came out. I was devastated! And then I found another water fountain at a park, but no water came out. Devastated again! A literal thirst trap! Finally I found a third fountain that worked. But it sprayed water everywhere! Only about a tenth of the water ended up In my mouth. The rest soaked my shirt and face.. But it was a good reminder of whey I am running. There are so many kids desperate for water in the world. Not only do they have to worry about finding water, but they have to worry about whether that water is clean. So I'm thankful that at least on out of every three water fountains worked for me.
