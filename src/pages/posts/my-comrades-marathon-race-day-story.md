I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and put on my running clothes. I was really nervous for this day. Luckily I wasn't too nervous to not enjoy breakfast.

I went downstairs and the breakfast area was packed! You saw jerseys of every bright color there is, orange, pink, blue and green. Hairy legs in short running shorts were everywhere!

Everyone was fueling up for the long day ahead of us.

I had some scrambled eggs and potatoes. Really hearty stuff. After that my team took some group photos in the lobby of our hotel.

We got on a bus and were dropped off near the starting line.

We had get through the crowd of thousands of people to get to our assigned place towards the front.

Despite it being 5 in the morning, it was a little warm with all of the people around us. And the air was thick with electricity and anticipation.

One of the best songs ever written,"Shosholoza" played and everyone knew the words. It isn't South Africa's national anthem, but it may as well be.

It's deeply a part of their culture. Even Nelson Mandela, when he was imprisoned in a labor camp, would sing this song to help pass by the time.

**You can see 19,000 people singing Shosholoza here:** [https://youtu.be/fGf56IhVK1U](https://youtu.be/fGf56IhVK1U "Watch 19,000 people sing Shosholoza")

There were people who arrived late and were trying to cut in front of the group. They were even climbing over the side fences to get in until security told them to stop.

For a good five to ten minutes it looked like the scene from World War Z where the zombies climb over the walls.

Then the classic running song "Chariots of Fire" played over the loud speaker.

This was it.

This was the race that I had been training for 6 months to do.

> A wise man once told me that the training for a race, especially for an ultra marathon was like mixing and baking a cake. The actual race is just the icing on top.

My training was intense!

I went on countless runs at 4 in the morning in the dark.

I also ran at night, in the dark.

Almost got hit by cars a few times.

There was one day where I ran 31 miles and then went to a close friend's wedding the same day, just to run another 26 miles the next morning.

Innumerable hours on hot roads.

Endless leg pain and ice.

Today was the icing on the cake.

## **The start line gun went off.**

It took us about 30 seconds to actually reach the start line where we ran through an explosion of red and white confetti.

We found our friend Brad, he was holding a sign with 4 orange balloons on the top of it so that we could find him. He tossed it into the cheering crowd once we found him.

Brad is a local and has ran this race 17 times!

So we decided to be smart and followed his advice on the course.

This meant doing a run, walk, run. Specifically walking the uphills, even the first ones when you're not tired.

His strategy was to conserve energy the first half of the race and then go all out the second half.

This was important because the whole first 26 miles were all up hill.

We did this and it was how we survived. There is 0 shame in walking the hills in this race.

Literally everyone except the professional runners walk all or part of the uphills.

At least that's what the people who actually finish do.

No one asks how fast you ran Comrades, the question is how many times have you done it?

## **Another important aspect of an ultra marathon is nutrition.**

An ultra marathon is basically an eating contest with a bit of running in between. You have to eat so much, otherwise you'll probably crash.

There were so many bananas, potatoes and other snacks along the way. I personally packed a bunch of Spring Energy and Gu Gels to supplement what was on the course. Also Coca-Cola cups were handed out to help our glucose levels not dip.

As a group we stuck with him for at least 16 miles (3.5 hours)

At mile 16 I felt like my heart was going to erupt out of my chest.

I checked my heart rate and it was at 174 bpm, well above where I needed to be at.

I was going too fast.

I decided to run my own race and if I was going to finish I needed to slow down and so I did and let the group go on without me.

I kept going but at a certain point my hip was killing me every time my leg lifted, especially when walking the uphills.

Our team leader, Josh, showed up and showed me some stretches to open up my hip and it was a God send!

I was able to run smoother after that.

## **I then ran into my roommate and he was cramping really bad.**

I prayed for him and we both went and got roadside massages and the massage therapist applied icy hot on them. It felt like heaven!

At one point he was cramping so bad and asked me if I had some salt pills, but I didn't bring any.

A guy behind us exclaimed that he did. This guy had really long, unkempt hear and a couple gold teeth and pulled out what looked like a dime bag with some white powder in it from out of his running belt.

Ummmâ€¦.

I made sure to let my roommate know to make sure that it was, in fact, salt.

Worst case scenario he would get a lot of energy and run faster. But it was actually salt.

We kept running together until the last 13 miles.

## **Throughout the run there were multiple times when I wanted to quit.**

I kept pushing but I was getting really tired.

I texted my wife and she prayed and encouraged me.

These hills were massive. There are 5 that have their own names. And multiple smaller ones that were challenging too.

I would remind myself of a mantra that I got out of a book called Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willick.

It's something you tell yourself when you are at your logical and emotional end.

> "I. Don't. Stop."

I repeated this mantra often throughout the race. "I. Don't. Stop."

I was in the last quarter of the race and people were cheering me on by name.

I saw the 11:30:00 group with their pacers and stuck with them for a while, but lost them when I had to use the bathroom.

The last 2KM I decided to give all I had left and ran as fast I could to try and get 11:30.

I ran hard.

**"I. Don't. Stop."**

There was a little hill leading into the stadium and felt like I was climbing Mt. Everest, but I dug deep and pressed on.

I made it into the stadium for the last 400M. Time on the clock was 11:28:30 seconds.

**"I. Don't. Stop."**

I saw my friends and team mates cheering for me as I entered and pushed myself as hard as I could go with the little bit of energy and strength I had left in me and finished at **11:30:52** seconds.

From there I received the tiniest, most beautiful medal that I will always cherish.

I walked over to my friends who had finished and were cheering on the remaining runners.

I collapsed on the grass. It felt so good to lay down after running for almost 12 hours straight.

I felt noxious and hungry.

I ate an apple to help settle my stomach.

The rest of our runners finished and we lined up to take a picture.

My stomach didn't feel good at all and I had to run and throw up the apple in the grass.

I probably projectile vomited 4 times, but felt so much better after.

After that, Team World Vision's tradition is to go to McDonald's.

Nothing was as fulfilling as that burger and fries that night. It was the bow on top of a pretty painful and perfect day.
