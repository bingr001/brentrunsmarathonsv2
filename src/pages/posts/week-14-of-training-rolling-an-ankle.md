This weekend I was mentally drained and exhausted.

This was another 26 then 20 weekend. I ran the 26 miles fine, but I woke up later than I wanted to on Sunday.

And it was Easter.

And it was really cold.

But I set out anyway.

I kept going and then I stepped on uneven pavement and rolled my ankle. I was 14.5 miles in and decided to finish at 15. I wanted to make sure that my ankle was okay and my groin muscle felt a bit thrashed as well. So I wanted to monitor those and make sure I was okay. It was not fun.

But I was able to recover within a couple days and keep running.
