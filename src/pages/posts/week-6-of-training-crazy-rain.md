Have you ever ran 20 miles during a torrential downpour where most of the streets are flooded? Yea, me neither…until today! I arrived at the park that I planned on running at. The parking spaces at this park are in the dirt so my first step outside the car was into fresh, slippery mud.

It was raining so hard!

But I had to my long run so off I went! By mile 3 I was completely drenched from head to toe, including my socks. Have you ever ran with soggy socks before? It felt like when you're at the beach and you take those first steps into the ocean. It was frigid and heavy. I chose to think about the kids that have had to endure worse, whose homes have been destroyed by floods or worse. So I chose not to complain but to be thankful and to pray for more people to sponsor those kids and use their resources both in their local community and beyond.

I'm training for a 54 mile marathon to raise awareness for child sponsorships. Click the link below to join the story and begin a life changing one on one relationship with a child!
