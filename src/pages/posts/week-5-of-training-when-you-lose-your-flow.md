I was really thrown off in my training from traveling to and from Atlanta in a span of a weekend. I was not able to sleep on the return ride home back to L.A. And we got back in around midnight. Also, flying with a toddler is not easy! The next day I woke up and was dead tired and not feeling well. I had to call out of work that day. That rolled into the next couple of days. But I was able to complete my long run that Saturday. It was a cut-back week and so I only ran 13 miles, but I got a little over confident and ran too fast and slightly injured my foot. This week I'm making sure to stretch more often so that I'm ready for this 20 miler on Saturday. Hopefully it goes well!
