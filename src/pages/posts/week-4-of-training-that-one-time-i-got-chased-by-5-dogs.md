I was in Georgia this past weekend to visit my sister and brother-in-law who just had twins. They live about 40 minutes north of Atlanta and it was COLD! It was a very crisp 35 degrees when I stepped out of their house. I almost walked back in, but then I thought about the reason WHY I was doing all of this and so I kept going, one foot in front of the other. I mapped out a run from their house down to the local state college and back. I didn't wear any headphones because I wanted to be as aware of my surroundings as possible, especially in a new place and especially in a more "country" part of the U.S. I was about a mile into my run where I saw 3 dogs sitting in the shade in a front yard. The front yard didn't have a fence. They perked up when they saw me and immediately starting barking and then running towards me. There was one big dog and two medium sized dogs and I expected that they would stop chasing me once they got to the street. They didn't. One of the smaller dogs nipped at my heel and I think that as I raised my heel up it nicked it in the face a little bit and it stopped. The larger dog looked like it's front paw was a little injured and it ran with a limp. I raised my voice and shouted at all three dogs to leave me alone and miraculously they stopped. I breathed a sigh of relief and kept on running. About 5 miles later I was passing by a broken down house with some rusting cars on the front lawn. I saw a tall, thin, older man with wispy hair holding onto the leash of one big, black dog. It was bigger than any of the previous dogs. Then out of some bushes on the side of the house 2 even bigger dogs starting running and barking in my direction. The older man screamed at them to stop and come back. They didn't listen. They kept running towards me. I stopped, looked for some type of stick on the ground to defend myself with, but there was nothing but leaves. So I placed my hand out and shouted "STOP! GO AWAY!" They looked confused for a second, then became disinterested and walked back to their owner.
