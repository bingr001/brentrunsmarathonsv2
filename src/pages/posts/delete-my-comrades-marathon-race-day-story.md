Woke up at 3:30 breakfast at 4 took some pictures with my team and got on the bus at 4:30.

We arrived at the start line along with 20 thousand other runners.

We piled into our corral group towards the front of those thousands of runners.

It was incredibly crowded with people wearing short running shorts, hats and colorful running shoes, but there was an exciting buzz and energy from everyone.

Played "Shosholoza" and the air was thick with anticipation

Late people were climbing over the fences to get into our corral and it looked like the scene from World War Z.

Chariots of fire played.

This was the race that I had been training for 6 months for.

Going on runs at 4 in the morning.

Running 31 miles and then going to a friend's wedding the same day, just to run another 26 miles the next morning.

Countless hours on the road.

Endless leg pain and icing.

A wise man once told me that the training and the Comrades race was like baking a cake.

The rooster crowed and the start line gun went off.

We found our friend Brad, he was holding a stick ith 4 orange balloons on the top of it so that we could find him. He tossed it into the cheering crowd once we found him.

We stuck with him and followed his advice on the course.

This included walking the uphills, even the first ones. His strategy was to conserve energy the first half of the race and then go all out the second half.

We did this and it was how we survived. There is 0 shame in walking the hills in this race.

Literally everyone except the elite professional runners walk all or part of the uphills.

At least that's what the people who actually finish do.

No one asks how fast you ran Comrades, the question is how many times have you done it?

As a group we stuck with him for at least 16 miles (3.5 hours)

The goal was to run a slower first marathon and save energy.

At mile 16 I felt like my heart was going to erupt out of my chest.

I checked my heart rate and it was at 184, well above what I needed to be at.

I was going too fast.

I decided to run my own race and if I was going to finish I needed to slow down and so I did and let the group go on without me.

I kept going but at a certain point my hip was killing me, especially when walking the uphills.

Our team leader showed up and showed me some stretches to open up my hip and it was a Godsend!

I was able to run smoother after that.

Along the course they had a lot of nutrition to choose from. There were these cool water packets that you bite the end of and drink from.

There were also cups of Coca Cola to help our glucose levels.

I then ran into my roommate and he was cramping really bad.

I prayed for him and we both went and got roadside massages and they applied icy hot on them. It felt like heaven.

At one point he was cramping so bad and asked me if I had some salt pills, but I didn't.

A guy behind us exclaimed that he did. This guy had really long, unkempt hear and a couple gold teeth and pulled out what looked like a dime bag with some white powder in it from out of his running belt.

I made sure to let my friend know to make sure that it was, in fact, salt.

Worst case scenario he would get a lot of energy and run faster. But it was actually salt.

We kept running together until the last 13 miles.

I kept pushing but I was getting really tired.

I texted my wife and she prayed and encouraged me.

I read a book on my flight there that really helped me to finish.

I repeated this mantra often throughout the race. "I. Don't. Stop."

I was in the last quarter of the race and people were cheering me on by name.

I saw the 11:30 "bus" and stuck with them for a while, but lost them when I had to use the bathroom.

The last 2KM I decided to give all I had left and ran as fast I could to try and get 11:30.

I ran hard.

"I.Don't.Stop."

There was a little hill leading into the stadium and felt like I was climbing Mt. Everest, but I dug deep and pressed on.

I made it into the stadium for the last 400M. Time on the clock was 11:28:30 seconds.

"I.Don't.Stop."

I saw my friends and team mates cheering for me as I entered and pushed myself as hard as I could go with the little bit of energy and strength I had left in me and finished at 11:30:52 seconds.

From there I received the tiniest, most beautiful medal that I will always cherish.

I walked over to my friends who had finished and were cheering on the remaining runners.

I collapsed on the grass. It felt so good to lay down after running for almost 12 hours straight.

I felt noxious and hungry.

I ate an apple to help settle my stomach.

The rest of our runners finished and we lined up to take a picture.

My stomach didn't feel good at all and I had to run and throw up the apple in the grass.

I probably projectiled 4 times, but felt so much better.

After that, Team World Vision's tradition is to go to McDonalds.

Nothing was as fulfilling as that burger and fries that night. It was the bow on top of a pretty perfect day.
