This was a milestone in my ultramarathon training. I ran 26 miles for this my long run this week. It was challenging, but luckily I got to run with some new friends and crashed an 80's 10k race! I started out running a 3 mile loop around the Rose Bowl before some friends got there. They were only running 18 miles that day so I planned on running a bit before they got there and a little bit more after they left. When we started running we noticed signs saying that the loop would be closed for an event and luckily they didn't kick us off of the loop. We noticed more and more people parking and police and event people showed up to set up and block off surrounding roads. We finally found out that there was a race happening that day.

A couple hours later the race started and we were inundated with runners dressed in spandex, tutus, fanny packs and fake afros. It was an 80's run! The only kinda sucky part was that it was also raining so a lot of people had to wear ponchos over their 80's clothes. We just went ahead and joined the pack and split off maybe a mile into it to run some hills. We kept running and pressing on and we stopped to get some water that a old Korean running group leave at certain points around the Rose Bowl. I think it was infused with corn husk sift. So it definitely tasted very different, but was refreshing at the same time. My friends finished and I pushed on to finish my 26 miles and went ahead and ran an extra .2 so that it would be a full marathon. It turned out to be an unofficial Personal Record of 4hr:15min:33secs! It's really fulfilling to see my efforts leading to improvements! I still have a lot longer to go in my training but I'm on my way!
