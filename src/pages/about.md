## I run marathons to make a difference in the world!

I was an avid runner in high school and in college and then I slowly dropped off.

In the most recent couple of years I picked up marathon running to help support causes that I support.

I have a background in IT and in [website development](https://www.brentjingram.com/ "brentjingram.com") and running  helps keep me active and stay in touch with my surroundings in L.A.
